  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
  <p>I couldn't find a drawing web app that respects a pressure sensitive stylus. So I decided to create my own.</p>

  <h2>Why are there so many features missing?</h2>
  <p>I try to keep it simple.</p>

  <h2>I have an idea for a feature!</h2>
  <p>Great! Let me know, you can email me at mettamage at protonmail dot com.</p>

  <h2>How can I draw with my friends?</h2>
  <p>Open op a Doodle Document and share the link with your friend. When they click on the link you shared, they'll be
    in the same Doodle Doc.</p>

  <h2>How do I know whether my friend and I see the same thing?</h2>
  <p>If you see someone else doodling that's how you know! What helps is that you text or talk to your friend while
    having this web app open.</p>

  <h2>How do I save my work</h2>
  <p>I'm working on that feature still. For now, a screenshot? ðŸ˜‡</p>

  <h2>I lost my work upon refresh</h2>
  <p>There is no saving functionality built-in yet.</p>

  <h2>I have another question!</h2>
  <p>Contact me somehow! I leave it up to you to figure it out ;-)</p>
